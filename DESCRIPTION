Description: BUGSnet (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling to conduct 
    NETwork meta-analysis) is a feature-rich R package to conduct Bayesian 
    network meta-analyses in compliance with best practice and reporting 
    guidelines. Bayesian analyses are conducted with JAGS. Outputs are 
    highly customizable and include network plots, tables of network 
    characteristics, league tables and league heat plots, SUCRA plots, 
    rankograms, forest plots, leverage plots, traceplots, posterior mean 
    deviance comparison plots.
